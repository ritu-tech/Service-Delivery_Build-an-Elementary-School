# Service-Delivery_Build-an-Elementary-School

**Project Description:**

The purpose of this Service Delivery Report is to provide an overview of the support services provided by the IT helpdesk at Dewsmouth Elementary School. The report focuses on the management of teaching and learning resources as well as the IT helpdesk operations. The IT helpdesk is responsible for addressing incidents related to devices used within the school, including desktops, iPads, and laptops. It also plays a key role in offering essential training to both students and teachers on technology usage.

The helpdesk will address issues raised by users through phone or web support, with the aim of resolving incidents in accordance with the established Service Level Agreement (SLA). Additionally, the IT helpdesk will encourage users to submit customer feedback surveys to continuously improve the quality of service delivery. The overall goal of the report is to ensure that the helpdesk services are effectively supporting the educational objectives of the school while maintaining high standards of technical support and user satisfaction.
